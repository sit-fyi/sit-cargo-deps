Public Interface
----------------

- The `acceptable()` method now accepts `Vec<&str>` instead of `&[String]`.

  fn main() {
	let question = Question::new("Continue?").acceptable(vec!["y", "n"]);
  }
  ```
- Added setter for providing `clarification`.
  Example:
  ```rust
  fn main() {
	let clarification = "Please enter one of (yes/no)";
	let question = Question::new("Continue?").clarification(clarification);
  }
  ```
