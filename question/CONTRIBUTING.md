# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue or email before making a change. It's a small focused library, dive in.

## GitHub Mirror

The project is mirrored to GitHub, but all development is done on GitLab. Please use the [GitLab issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/starshell/question/issues). Want to open an issue but don't have a GitLab account? Just email `incoming+starshell/question@gitlab.com` and those emails automatically become issues (with the comments becoming the email conversation).
