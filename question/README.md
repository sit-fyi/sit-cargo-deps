A Command Line Question Asker for Rust.

> Ask a question, what more could you want?

Easy to use library for asking users questions when writing console/terminal applications.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Warning:** This is my first released rust project, still very new, and not yet completely tested. That said it is very small and focused so it should come together quickly, and will likely continue to be maintained/extended since I write lots of CLI applications.

Also, as indicated by the version none of the public API is yet stable. Suggestions are welcome.

## Usage

Add `question` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` to use from crates.io:

```toml
[dependencies]
question = "0.2.1"
```

Then add `extern crate question;` to your crate root and run `cargo build` or `cargo update && cargo build` for your project. Detailed documentation for releases can be found on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/question/) and the bleeding edge docs for the latest GitLab repository version can be found on [GitLab pages](http://starshell.gitlab.io/question/question/).

### Example

```rust
extern crate question;
use question::{Answer, Question};

fn main() {
    let answer = Question::new("Continue?")
        .default(Answer::YES)
        .show_defaults()
        .confirm();

    if answer == Answer::YES {
        println!("Onward then!");
    } else {
        println!("Aborting...");
    }
}
```

Examples can also be ran directly:

```sh
$ cargo run --example yes_no_with_defaults
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/examples/yes_no_with_defaults`
Continue? (Y/n) why
Continue? (Y/n) y
Onward then!
```
